All tests consist of an input file and an output file.

The input file MUST contain as the first line a '#'
comment, even if that is an empty comment (i.e. only
the '#' by itself).  This is because we allow
additional options to be specified with which the tool
should be invoked.

That is, if the test needs to invoke the tool with the
'-f foo' and '-b bar' flags, then the first line of
the input file should be:

# -f foo -b bar
